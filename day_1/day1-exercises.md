## Questions:

**1.  On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?**

      HTML adds content to a website with a structure and interactive features that can be expounded upon in CSS and JavaScript.

**2.  What is the difference between an element and a tag?**

      An element is the tag alongside the content it holds, like a specific section or block of HTML. The tag is just the name of the bit that holds the element's name or defining structure, usually encased in: <tag>.

**3.  Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?**

      Attributes help identify and specify the content, making it easier to access a specific element in CSS or JavaScript, as well as indicating things like width and height of an image to be displayed. Things like id can specify a specific bit of tagged text, whereas class can refer to a set of similar things that can all be grouped and access via attributes. It is possible to use style attributes within the HTML itself and not use CSS, but this is not best practice to keep code clear.

**4.  Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.**

      The head stores metadata, or information about the page, such as links to the CSS and JS files, the title--which is the name to be displayed on the tab--the style of HTML being used, etc. The body is where visible content, anything seen by the users of the website, will be stored.

**5.  In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?**

**6.  List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, `<p></p>` is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.**

      1. <header>This is a header for things like a title and index.</header>

      2. <ul>This is an unordered list, like bullet points.</ul>

      3. <ol>This is an ordered list, like this numbered list.</ol>

      4. <div>This is a division, or a section. You can use this to break up different subjects or parts of the webpage for easier access or to id them. They can be tables or lists or things that aren't paragraphs, but may contain paragraphs.</div>

      5. <footer>This is a footer, for thinks like links to a contact email or other related sites, or copyright notice.</footer>


**7.  What are empty elements?**

      Empty elements don't contain closing tags; common ones include:
        * <img>
        * <embed>
        * <link
        * <input>
        * <meta>
        * <col>
        * <source>
        * <br>
        * <hr>

**8.  What is semantic markup?**

      Semantic markup is conveying meaning about each element in a document through properly selected HTML, in order to separate the visual presentation from the content. It allows websites to be more searchable and accessible without crowding it with formatting. It's the best practice to let both humans and computers access the content.

**9.  What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.**

      1. <nav>This helps indicate the index of navigation links commonly found on websites to help get to different pages.</nav>

      2. <article>This is a self-contained document within the page, such as a news article or blog post, that could be independently distributed outside the website.</article>

      3. <aside>This is a note or quote or piece of commentary which enhances the experience of the content but isn't strictly necessary or is indirectly related. This might be a sidebar or call-out box.</aside>
